# React Name Submission App

This is a simple React application that captures user input and displays a greeting message with the inputted name upon form submission.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

1. **`App.js`**: Contains the main application logic.
2. **`index.js`**: Responsible for rendering the `App` component to the DOM.

## Features

- **User Input Handling**: The application allows users to input their name, which is stored in the component's state.
- **Form Submission**: Upon clicking the submit button, the entered name is displayed in a greeting message on the screen.
- **State Management**: The application uses React's `useState` hook to manage the input value and the displayed greeting.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- The application consists of a single input field where users can enter their name.
- As the user types, the input value is logged to the console.
- When the "Submit" button is clicked, the name is displayed in a greeting message above the input field.

## Code Explanation

### `App.js`

- **State Management**: The `App` component uses `useState` to manage two pieces of state:
  - `name`: Stores the user's input.
  - `headingText`: Stores the text to be displayed in the greeting.

- **Event Handling**:
  - `handleChange`: Updates the `name` state with the current value of the input field as the user types.
  - `handleClick`: Sets the `headingText` state to the current value of `name` when the form is submitted.

- **Rendering**: The component renders a `div` containing a `h1` element for the greeting and a form with an input field and a submit button.

### `index.js`

- The `index.js` file imports the `App` component and renders it to the DOM at the HTML element with the ID `root`.
